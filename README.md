# ImageCompression

This repository presents the technical part of my Bachelor project. This project aims to investigate the effects of image compression on classification accuracy of pre-trained CNNs.

The Experiments.ipynb is the main notebook containing the experiment pipeline.

The Graphs.ipynb is the notebook used to generate the graphs and the scores used for model evaluation.
